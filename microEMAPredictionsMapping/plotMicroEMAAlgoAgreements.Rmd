library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
```

mapped10Sec <- read.csv("C:/Users/Dharam/Downloads/microEMA/StudyFiles/CombinedData/predictions_10.csv")

head(mapped10Sec)
tail(mapped10Sec)
```

#### Convert date time to date time objects

```{r}
mapped10Sec$PROMPT_TIME <- as.POSIXct(mapped10Sec$PROMPT_TIME, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS")
head(mapped10Sec)


mapped10Sec$PREDICTIONS <- 1
mapped10Sec$RESPONSES <- 1
```

#### Plot activity types as time series for each participant

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
